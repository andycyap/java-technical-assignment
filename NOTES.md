## Addendum

Hi there!

Design should abstract the Discount Engine so that the Basket and Discount Engine is loosely coupled

Rules might have tight coupling with the basket, need to rework the design

Rework the Unit Test so that the discounts are applied.  On top of the DiscountEngineTest (make sure nothing is broken as baseline), create a test for Buy one get one free.

Documentation could be better so that the next developer knows how to implement the next steps.

Thanks for the technical test!
